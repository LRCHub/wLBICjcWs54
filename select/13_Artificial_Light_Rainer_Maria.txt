No one defies artificial light.
No one defies artificial light.
No one defies artificial light.
(Waiting for you to decide)
No one defies artificial light.
(Waiting for you to decide)

Simultaneous sitting 'til you atrophy
Maybe you try to be pretty instead of kind
Why is this technology an anathema to me?
If I could just breath it out
I could always breathe back in

Simultaneous sitting 'til you atrophy

Maybe you try to be pretty instead of kind
Why is this technology an anathema to me?
If I could just breath it out
I could always breathe back in
Always breathe back in

I'll cut all your wires
I never cared
Cut all your wires
What can be there? It's dead.
And all the invisible arcs
Are caught in my head
And the invisible arcs
Are caught in my head
