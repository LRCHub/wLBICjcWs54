So the sign of coming events
Flickers with missing words
And the bright blue city where
My friend have played
Fades from the corner of an eye

Tell my foes I'm captain tonight
Tell my folks I'm dead

I don't wanna see them

Artificial light I'm clinging
Artificial light
And praying it won't burn out
Artificial light
